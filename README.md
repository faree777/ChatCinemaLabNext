ChatCinema: A Conversational Movie Recommendation System
Overview
ChatCinema is a conversational movie recommendation system that uses natural language processing and machine learning to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user input. The system is built using Streamlit, a Python library for building web applications, and leverages the power of Groq, a vector database, to store and retrieve movie embeddings.
